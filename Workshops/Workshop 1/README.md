# How we did the workshop...
To realize this workshop, we did a system analysis. We first identified the main components of the NCAA Basketball Tournament system through a review of its structure and stakeholders. Then, we mapped the relationships between these elements to understand their influence and how they interact throughout the season. Later, we did a sensitivity analysis to find out how changes in key factors (for example injuries or venue location) might affect outcomes. Finally, we used ideas from chaos theory and complexity science to explore how unpredictable and dynamic the tournament can be.
